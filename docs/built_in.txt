This file documents the names, arguments, behavior, and return value of built-in names in Zymux.

The style of built-in function documentation is the following:
    {return type} name(arg1, arg2... optional1={value}, optional2={value}...):
        {documentation}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

null print(value, newline=true, destructure=false):
    Prints the passed value to the output.

    newline: whether or not to print an extra newline at the end of the print. It's there
    to allow manually setting it off to print inline.

    destructure: whether or not it should treat the print value as an iterable and print
    each of its elements as an independant print, for convenience. If this is enabled alongside
    the newlines boolean, then it prints a newline after every object of the iterable value.

null assert(condition, message="Assert failure."):
    Raises an error if condition is false, then prints message.
    Does nothing if the condition evaluates to true.

    message: The message which gets printed on error. Expected to be a string.

float time():
    Returns the time which has passed since the beginning of the program.
    Measured with how many clock ticks have been used since the start of the program.
