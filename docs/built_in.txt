This file documents the names, arguments, behavior, and return value of built-in names in Zymux.

The style of built-in function documentation is the following:
    return_type {name}(arg1, arg2, arg3...):
        {documentation}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

null print(value):
    Prints the passed value to the output.

null assert(condition, message):
    Raises an error if condition is false, then prints message.
    Does nothing if the condition evaluates to true.

    the parameter message is expected to be a string, otherwise that'll be an error itself.

float time():
    Returns the time which has passed since the beginning of the program.
    Measured with how many clock ticks have been used since the start of the program.
