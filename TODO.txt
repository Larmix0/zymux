This is a temporary TODOs file for things that are to be done later on in the language.
This will (likely) be deleted once Zymux's development is mostly finished.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allow backslashes at lexer to skip escapes (like skipping a newline before it happens).
Also, allow escaping actual escapes in strings?

"nothing" keyword which assigns to nothing. Useful for throwaway assignments in multi-assignments.
Also, maybe can be used with "is" in order to mean an "empty" datatype
(like 0 for int, "" for strings, [] for lists, and {} for maps instead of null?).

Issue warnings for weird edge cases for the language. Example:
    AST finding the expression condition of an if/while to be an assignment.
(Allow warnings to be disabled with a certain flag)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optimization:
    1. More efficient vm loops with dispatch tables utilizing goto.

    2. Optimize node memory for unary/binary nodes by storing their operation token as just
        the source position and a token type enum value.

    3. Change certain macros to use the normal type instead of pointer to optimize dereferencing.
        (In other words, use the dot operator instead of the arrow).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

make maps uniterable and instead call a method that retrieves the map as a 2d list,
which is a list of 2 element lists that represent the key and value. This will be done
only when fields and methods are added to built-in objects. This is to allow the user to potentially
see the order of the iterating map before the iteration happens.

Improve the positioning of some bytecode for error handling.

Is not recursing in object_cstring actually helpful, or do we just need to just print all freed
objects at the end of the program before manually freeing them without printing to avoid memory
issues. Not to mention it's useful for printing more object info in threads and such.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make methods' first character of the class capitalized in the internal name for conventions,
and full/clear separation from other functions.
