This is a temporary TODOs file for things that are to be done later on in the language.
This will (likely) be deleted once Zymux's development is mostly finished.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name the slash/backslash that seperates folders of imports "delimiter".

"nothing" keyword which assigns to nothing. Useful for throwaway assignments in multi-assignments.
Also, maybe can be used with "is" in order to mean an "empty" datatype
(like 0 for int, "" for strings, [] for lists, and {} for maps).

Because every function in Zymux is created during compilation as a constant (and not runtime),
we can actually attach an integer "constIdx" to each function,
representing the index in the constant pool of a chunk they're on (perhaps -1 if <script>).
Then, after compilation we just iterate through the VM's FrameStack of functions,
and look at their constIdxs one by one to immediately head straight to the erroneous function.
Actually, the "constIdx" member can be part of the frame instead of the function,
and it gets set on whenever we append a function maybe?
This'll allow us to just find the function that errored directly instead of using its name
(which doesn't work as multiple functions at different scopes can have the same name).

Issue warnings for weird edge cases for the language. Example:
    AST finding the expression condition of an if/while to be an assignment.
(Allow warnings to be disabled with a certain flag or something)

Optimization:
    1. Heavily optimize memory usage in parser by traversing the AST for freeing nodes
        instead of having a linked list. This saves the need for an 8 byte "next" pointer.
        Potentially use an arena to avoid the linked list for objects too, as all objects
        are in front of each other in the arena. Might also increase or even decrease performance?
        Gotta benchmark it, though.

    2. Change certain macros to use the normal type instead of pointer to optimize dereferencing.
        (In other words, use the dot operator instead of the arrow).

    3. Perhaps optimize bytecode by putting constants after the instructions themselves,
        but with 1 extra byte to identify them.
        Example:
            Add operation expected 2 instructions after. They may be OP_ARG_8/16/32.
            First byte is the OP_ARG_X, then depending on that we know how many bytes to read
            for the const indices.
            This shouldn't increase the amount of bytecode as identifying the first byte
            would need to be there for the dispatch loop to know the const instruction anyways.

            Gotta bench mark the performance in math expressions before doing it everywhere, though.

Code for a buffer append using variadic arguments just in case.

/** Appends to the buffer a format using an already made VA list. */
void buffer_append_va(CharBuffer *buffer, const char *format, va_list *args) {
    va_list argsForLength;
    va_copy(argsForLength, *args);

    const int formatLength = vsnprintf(NULL, 0, format, argsForLength);
    if (buffer->length + formatLength + 1 > buffer->capacity) {
        buffer->capacity += formatLength * 2;
        buffer->data = ZMX_REALLOC_ARRAY(buffer->data, buffer->capacity, sizeof(char));
    }
    // -1 because char buffer's take NUL into account. +1 to length of format is for writing NUL.
    vsnprintf(buffer->data + buffer->length - 1, formatLength + 1, format, args);
    buffer->length += formatLength;
}

Optimize/fix: interpolated strings building always starts with an empty string.
